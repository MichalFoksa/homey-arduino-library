# Arduino library for communicating with an Arduino
This Arduino library allows your project to talk with Homey the easy way. Almostâ„¢ no configuration required!

# Compatibility
The library should work on most official Arduino boards, ESP8266 based boards and ESP32 based boards.
When using an Arduino board both the official ethernet shield version 1 and 2 are supported.

# Using the library
See the included examples and the readme of the app repository at https://github.com/athombv/com.athom.arduino
